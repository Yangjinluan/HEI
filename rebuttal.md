**Our contributions:**

**(a) Problem view:** a new distribution shift perspective(node's neighbor pattern gap between train and test) to promote node representation learning on heterophilic graphs. **Compared with previous works that aim to design a more effective HGNN backbone, we are the first to reconsider the node representation aggregation from data distribution, thus further integrating with existing SOTA HGNN's backbones to achieve better performance(line214-line246)**. Notably, the data distribution means that **we should compare the structure-related distribution between train and test datasets(Figure 7) on the same dataset rather than directly statistics on the full dataset like many other studies.** 

**(b) Technique view:** To address our pointed distribution shift, we make a detailed theoretical analysis to explain why previous graph-based invariant learning methods can't work well(Figure 1, line 271-281,line341, line 381). \textbf{Compared with previous works that generate extra augmented graphs by mask strategy to construct different environments(Figure 1, line 312-340), we utilize the node's inherent neighbor pattern information to infer environments without augmentation.} Then a natural question arises as bold by lines 147,151, **how can we ensure the effectiveness of our proposed graph-based invariant learning methods? Thus, we should provide strict theory evidence for selecting a proper matrix to estimate the node's neighbor pattern from a graph perspective(Section 4.1) and casual invariant learning perspective(Section 4.3)** rather than only from experimental results. A more detailed analysis can be found in the appendix(Figure 5, A.2).
